# Fruit Classification and Freshness Detection

Welcome to the Fruit Classification and Freshness Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources for classifying different types of fruits using a deep learning model and detecting their freshness using color and texture features with a Random Forest regressor.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide an automated system for classifying different types of fruits and detecting their freshness. The classification is performed using a deep learning model, while the freshness detection utilizes color and texture features fed into a Random Forest regressor to estimate the percentage of freshness.

## Features
- **Fruit Classification:** Identify different types of fruits using a deep learning model.
- **Freshness Detection:** Estimate the freshness of the fruit based on color and texture features.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for classifying and detecting fruit freshness.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aparnah30/Fruit_freshness.git
